# About

I have built this simple api with node, express and mongoose
in order to gain backend skills. This api in conjunction with a
MongoDB database performs CRUD operations which means that consumers
of this API can create, retrieve, update, and delete people info

It can be [tested in postman](https://red-space-647766.postman.co/workspace/Team-Workspace~c2b9b79d-197b-4498-8ed4-252821f24072/collection/28779286-6f565efd-f8be-4e78-b5e1-8b3e92a57d9d?action=share&creator=28779286)

## What I learned

- Setting up a node-express server
- Conventional source structure i.e grouping routes, models, and controllers
- Express middleware
- Mongoose schemas, models and documents and related methods
- Routing and method chaining
